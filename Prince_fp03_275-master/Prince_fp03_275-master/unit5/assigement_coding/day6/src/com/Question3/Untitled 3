Develop a Producer- consumer problem using the wait and notify method in such a way that:

- Producer thread should produce a number continuously
- Consumer thread should consume the produced number of Producer thread and print that number.

**Note:**

No number should be generated twice and no number should be printed twice.

that means, first of all, the producer thread should produce a 
number after this it has to notify the consumer thread and it(the producer thread)
 goes into the wait state.

meanwhile, The consumer thread should print the
 produced value on the console and go into the wait state. before going to the wait state 
 it should notify the producer thread so that the producer thread will generate a new number 
 and this process continues.
