Consider the following Bean classes:

```java
class Address{
state: String
city: String
pincode: String
}
class Employee{
empId: int
empName: String
salary: int
email: String
password: String
address: Address //has-A relationship
}
```

Inside the Demo1 class Serialize the List of 5 Employee objects with all details
inside a file called “employeedata.txt”
● Make sure that the employee’s password should not be serialized.
● Inside the Demo2 class Deserialize the List of Employees from the “employeedata.txt”
● After Deserialization, add one more Employee object inside that List and
Serialize it back to the “employeedata.txt” file.
