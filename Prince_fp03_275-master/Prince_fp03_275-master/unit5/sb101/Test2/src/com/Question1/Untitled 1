Create a multithreaded Producer-Consumer application, where the Producer
Thread will produce a number. And the Consumer thread should print the sum of
all the numbers till that produced number starts from 0.
Example:
Producer Produced : 0
Consumer Calculated Sum is: 0
Producer Produced: 1
Consumer Calculated Sum is: 1
Producer Produced: 2
Consumer Calculated Sum is: 3
Producer Produced : 3
Consumer Calculated Sum is: 6
Producer Produced: 4
Consumer Calculated Sum is: 10
Producer Produced: 5
Consumer Calculated Sum is: 15
