Create a Thread Pool of 3 Threads, and submit the 6 tasks using the Callable

interface. Each task should accept a Student object (roll, name, address, marks )through
the constructor and return the result of that student with his roll number.

Example:
If supplied Student object is: new Student(10, “Varun”, “Pune”, 450); 

Then the thread should return: “Roll 10 student is Fail”
