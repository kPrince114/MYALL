**Develop a multithreaded application in which**

1.- From the main method create an empty List of cities and pass this empty city list to the child thread

2.- The child thread should add 4 cities inside this List by taking input from the user.
3.- Once the child Thread added the cities to that List then the main thread should print all the cities added by the child thread one by one.
