## **Problem 3 :**

**Create a multithreaded application in which start 2 threads:**

1. Salman thread:
2. Hritik thread:
- Salman Thread should print all the even numbers starting from 0 to 20
- Hritik Thread should print all the odd numbers starting from 0 to 20.
- Both threads should print the number by taking a 1-second pause.

**Note:** Salman Thread should wait until the complete execution of the Hritik Thread. (make use of the Join method)
