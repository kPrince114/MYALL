Consider the following class:

			class A{
		
		public static void funA(){
		
		for(int i=1;i <=10; i++){
		
		System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName()+” is running”);
		
		}
		
		}
		
		public void funB(){
		
		for(int i=20;i <=30; i++){
		
		System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName()+” is running”);
		
		}
		
		}
		
		}
		
		- Develop a multithreaded application to run funA and funB as two different threads using Method Reference.
- Set the name of Thread 1 as Dhoni thread and Thread 2 as Kohli thread.
