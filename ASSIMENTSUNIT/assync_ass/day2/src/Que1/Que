Interface Demo{
public int convetStringToNumber(String s);
}
```

## Problem 2 :

Implement the following method of a functional interface using the method reference.

```java
Interface Demo{
public void printDetail(Student student);
}
```

interface PrintList {
abstract void display(List<String> city);
}
```

From the main method, call the above method by supplying a List of 5 cities.

## Problem 4 :
