// What is the Difference between the wait and sleep methods?
// 1. Wait() method belongs to Object class. and Sleep() method belongs to Thread class.
//2. Wait() method releases lock during Synchronization. and Sleep() method does not release the lock on object during Synchronization.
// 3.Wait() should be called only from Synchronized context. and  There is no need to call sleep() from Synchronized context.
// 4.Wait() is not a static method.  and  Sleep() is a static method.
