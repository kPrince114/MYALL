//# You Problem:
//
//- Create a Employee Bean class with following 3 fields:
//
//    int empId, String name, int salary.
//
//- Implement the Comparable interface within the Employee class and define the sorting logic according to the salary,
// and if 2 Employee salary is same then sort them according to their name.
//- Create a Main class with main method and inside the main class create a TreeSet class object
// which can hold multiple Employee object.
//- Add 5 Employee object with some dummy data and print each Each Employee object one by one from the TreeSet object.
